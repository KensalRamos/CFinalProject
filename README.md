# CFinalProject
For the Final Project, you will need to create an address book program, which will utilize a menu system and the equivalent of a database.
The menu system should use a main menu and submenus as needed, and allow the user to preform the typical features of a database, i.e., 
Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) as follows:

Create - add a new record to the address book validating the information to make sure each new record has good data
Retrieve - search and display one or more sorted records, or parts of records, back to the user as requested, or an error message
indicating no records were found
Update - change/edit an existing record, utilizing the above as needed
Delete - remove a record from the address book, making sure to ask the user if they are sure

The database portion of the program could be created using an array of structures, link list or tree, and should utilize pointers
appropriately. The database should consist of the typical fields you would find in an address book, e.g., ID, first name, last name, 
street address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. I highly recommend you work ahead in the book to learn 
about the above items before we discuss them in class.

Do NOT do this part until you get the above thoroughly working and tested,
and then, make a copy of that program before doing this part. 
For extra credit, have your program save any records from memory to a binary file, and then, use that file, if it exist, 
the next time the program runs. Please keep in mind, reference type variables, e.g., arrays, pointers, strings, etc., only contain 
a memory address, so you may need to copy the actual data to which the reference variable points and send the actual data to your file, 
NOT the memory address.

Once you have a working program, make sure it is documented and formatted according to the Code Conventions including appropriate
PPR comments for every function. Then, copy and paste your comments and code into a Microsoft Word document, save and close it, attach
it to this assignment, submit it, and verify what was submitted was the correct information. I will only be grading your last submission,
but if you would like me to look at your code prior to that, make sure you e-mail it to me several days before it is due, so I have time
to respond.
